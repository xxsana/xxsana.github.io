description: Let's see the testcode of a ThunkCreator which has API calls and business logic about the API response.

There's this testcode of iOS project and Iâ€™d like to focus on the expectation part.


```swift

import XCTest  
  
func commonSetup() {  
    // set store, thunkCreator...  
}  
  
func useCase1pattern() {  
    let condition1 = "something differs"  
    let condition2 = "something differs"  
      
    commonExecutor(apiParameter1: condition1, apiParameter2: condition2, expectResult: "result", testDescription: "should be something")  
}  
  
  
func commonExecutor(apiParameter1: String, apiParameter2: String, expectResult: String, testDescription: String) {  
    commonSetup()  
      
    let expectation = Expectation  
    expectation.expectedFulfillmentCount = 1  
      
    store.state.afterResult  
        .subscribe(onNext: { afterResult in  
            XCTAssertEqual(expectResult, afterResult, testDescription)  
            expectation.fulfill()  
        }).disposed(by: disposeBag)  
      
    let apiParameter = Parameter(apiParameter1, apiParameter2)  
    state.dispatch(thunkCreator.send(element: apiParameter))  
      
    waitForExpectations(timeout: 1, handler: nil)  
}

```
  

#### Swift document
[<img src="[Screenshot 2024-11-10 at 15.01.51.png]">](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/asynchronous_tests_and_expectations)


Itâ€™s used for asynchronous code because asynchronous code could be not executed on main thread.

Two approaches for testing asynchronous code
1. For async/await code, `func testBlah() async throws {}`
2. Not async/await code but also asynchronous code, use `expectations` and control the `waiting/fulfillment`

<hr>

  

#### Usage

```swift
// Create an expectation for an asynchronous task.  
let expectation = XCTestExpectation(description: "Open a file asynchronously.")  
  
let fileManager = ExampleFileManager()  
  
// Perform the asynchronous task.  
fileManager.openFileAsync(with: "exampleFilename") { file, error in  
in  
    // Assert that the asynchronous task worked.  
    XCTAssertNotNil(file, "Expected to load a file.")  
  
  
    // Assert that no errors occurred opening the file asynchronously.  
    XCTAssertNil(error, "Expected no errors loading a file.")  
      
    // Fulfill the expectation.  
    expectation.fulfill()  
}  
  
  
// Wait for the expectation to fulfill or time out.  
wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 10.0)
```
  

<hr>

I quite got it, but also got a question why it doesnâ€™t use async throws test function because our asynchronous API request is using async code like below.


```swift
extension GETAsyncRequestable where Self: AsyncRequestBase {  
    func send(with parameter: Parameter) async throws -> Response {  
        createRequest(...)  
          
        return try await requestJson()  
    }  
}
```




Then I figured out that our ThunkCreatorâ€™s send function(the one be tested up there) is not async function and it coud be refactored. Iâ€™m gonna try to refactor and upload Pull Request about that in couple days ðŸ˜™
