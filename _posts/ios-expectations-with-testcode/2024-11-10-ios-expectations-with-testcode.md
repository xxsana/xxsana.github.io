The website was made using Jekyll the one of open source static sites generator, and using my own simple theme, I called [klisé](https://github.com/piharpi/klise).

All the services are free, source code the site was placed on my [github](https://github.com/piharpi/mahendrata.now.sh) repository and intergration with ~~[netlify](https://netlify.com)~~ service, another service that you can use is [github page](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting your own static site.
